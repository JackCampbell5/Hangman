# Hangman

## About
+ This is an android app that I created to practice Java 
+ It is based off of a text only Hangman game I created in Java when i originally learned the language
+ This was originally finished in November of 2020 and probably does not work with the newest API version but that has yet to be tested

## App Basics
+ You start at level one and have 4 random words you need to guess and if you get them all right you are given the code to the next level
+ There are 30 levels in total 
+ Make sure to memorize the codes to the next level otherwise you have to play the previous level to get the code again
